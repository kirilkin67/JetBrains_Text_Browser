Behold, the power of Requests III:
Requests III allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2 (wip) requests,
without the need for manual thought-labor. There’s no need to add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, as well.
Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over ~1.6 million
installations per day!
Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Heroku, DigitalOcean, RedHat, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, &c all use Requests to query internal HTTPS services.

While retaining all the features of Requests Classic:
This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some
background information about Requests, then focuses on step-by-step
instructions for getting the most out of Requests.
This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, details the
Requests ecosystem and community.
If you are looking for information on a specific function, class, or method,

There are no more guides. You are now guideless.
Good luck.
